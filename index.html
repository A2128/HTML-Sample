    <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Giyu Tomioka</h1>
    <p>
        The Water Hashira and the first Demon Slayer that Tanjiro meets.
        He initially tries to kill Nezuko but reconsiders after she protects Tanjiro from him, and directs them to his mentor Sakonji Urokodaki in hopes that Tanjiro could succeed him and possibly cure Nezuko.
        Beneath his aloof and unemotional exterior, he suffers from an inferiority complex stemming from survivor's guilt during Final Selection and does not believe he is a true Hashira.
        He developed an additional self-taught form of Water Breathing.
        Giyu and Tanjiro battle Akaza in the Infinity Castle, and later are the first to face Muzan.
        He loses his left arm during the battle, but survives.
        In the Reiwa Era, Giyu's reincarnation is a child named Giichi, who is close friends with Sabito and Makomo's reincarnations.

    <p>
        While Giyu was training under Sakonji Urokodaki, he wore a dark red haori which would later make up his current one as well as black tucked-in tattsuke-hakama pants and his current white leg-wrapped kyahan and pair of white zōri with dark blue straps.
        In addition, he also wears the warding masks that are signature to Sakonji's pupils.
        For Giyu, it is a white fox mask with light blue eyes.

    <h3>Giyu Abilities and Strenght</h3>
    <img src="css/img/wp4934611.jpg" height="500px" id="img1">

    <p>Indomitable Will: Giyu possesses an undaunted will and indomitable will, never giving up despite suffering numerous injuries against Akaza, one of the strongest demons in existence and later on the Demon King, Muzan. Even when losing his arm, he still remained steadfast and managed to play an important role in defeating Muzan. When Tanjiro was turned into a demon, Giyu was the first to act in order to protect the survivors, and even when it seemed that Tanjiro was unable to be killed by any means, he was not phased and continued to fight</p>
    <p>Tactical Intellect: Giyu possessed great tactical intellect and sharp observation, always remaining calm, composed, and focused on analyzing the situation and reacting accordingly. When he initially fought Tanjiro, he was able to immediately understand Tanjiro’s strategy with his hidden hatchet throw. He has also displayed sharp critical thinking and accurate tactical analysis mid-battle, precisely determining and noting details with his keen observation. In his clash with Akaza, Giyu was able to keep pace during the high-speed battle, while critically noting the precision and accuracy of his techniques and instantaneous adaptation, and the intense overall nature of the Upper Rank. Additionally, Giyu also shows good survival skills; after fighting Akaza and bleeding profusely from his sustained wounds, Giyu lit a fire and heated his sword to cauterize his wounds. In his confrontation with Muzan, when Tanjiro tried to fight head on out of anger, Giyu advised the strategy of stalling the demon instead until allies arrived.</p>

        Immense Speed & Reflexes: Giyu possesses inhuman speed and reflexes, as shown when he took Nezuko away from Tanjiro's grasps at blinding speeds, which took him several seconds to register. Later, he was able to hoist and tie Inosuke up to a tree before he even realized what happened, causing him to remark that he's extremely fast. Giyu also easily caught up to Shinobu when she was pursuing Tanjiro. In his battle with Lower Five, Giyu could cut all of Rui's threads so fast that it seemed like he didn't move his arms at all, and was later able to nonchalantly decapitate the demon in the moment he had blinked. He was also able to keep up with Upper Rank Three, Akaza, who is one of the fastest demons in existence and when he awakened his mark, Giyu managed to surprise him several times and appeared to "teleport" even to Akaza. Giyu also managed to evade many of Muzan's attacks and negate them with his form Dead Calm.</p>

    <p>Immense Stamina & Endurance: Due to extremely harsh training, Giyu has attained incredible stamina and endurance. In his battle against Akaza, he managed to continue fighting even after sustaining dozens of injuries all over his body, severely weakening him, a feat which pleasantly surprised Akaza. Additionally, he was seen cauterizing his wounds by heating up his blade with a fire. During the final clash with the Demon King, Giyu managed to hold off Muzan despite initially being inflicted with his poisonous blood, and later still played a pivotal role in his defeat after his arm was cut off by helping Tanjiro turn his blade bright red. Even after the entire ordeal, when Tanjiro was transformed into a demon, Giyu still had enough energy left to fight him off for a brief period of time.[3] Giyu was also one of only two Hashira to survive the final battle in the end.</p>
